## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are typically used to identify a user, authenticate them, and provide them with access to resources or services. JWTs are commonly used in web applications and APIs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted.

This repository serves as a practical guide and resource for understanding JWTs, how to create them, validate them, and use them in your applications.

## Getting Started

Before you begin using this repository, make sure you have a basic understanding of JWT concepts. If you are new to JWT, you can start with the following resources:

- [JWT Introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction)
- [RFC 7519 - JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jscode99/jwt-workbook.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Examples**: Check out the example code and documentation in the repository to learn about JWT creation, validation, and usage.

3. **Run the Examples**: Follow the instructions in the examples to run them on your local environment (Create a local .env file with appropriate variables).

4. **Customize for Your Needs**: Modify the examples and integrate JWT into your own projects as needed.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `server/`: Contains example code for creating a demo server in Express.js along with a handler/route called posts which is being retrieved only using the sucess of JWT token generation.
